//Assignment No 10
//Perform operations like joins, group by, and aggregations in Hive.

1. Creating a Hive Table

CREATE TABLE employees (
 emp_id INT,
 emp_name STRING,
 emp_salary DOUBLE,
 emp_department STRING
) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

CREATE TABLE departments (
 dept_id INT,
 dept_name STRING,
) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;


//Insert 5 record on each table by using insert command
//2. Joins

SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d
ON e.emp_department = d.dept_id;
 

//3. Aggregate Functions

a. Count the number of employees:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
 
b. Find the average salary:
 SELECT AVG(emp_salary) FROM employees;

c. Find the highest salary:
 SELECT MAX(emp_salary) FROM employees;

4. Group By
//Group by department and get average salary per department:
 SELECT emp_department, AVG(emp_salary) FROM employees GROUP BY emp_department;
